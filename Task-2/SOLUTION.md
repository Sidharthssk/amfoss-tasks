#Detailed terminal commands:

Step 1:
     
        cd Desktop                   (Change directory to desktop)
        mkdir Coordinate-Locations   (make a directory coordinate locations in desktop)
        cd Coordinate-Locations      (change directory to coordinate locations)
        
Step 2:
        
        mkdir North                  (create a directory north)
        cd North                     (change directory to north)
        touch NDegree.txt            (create a file called NDegree.txt in North folder)
        echo 9>>Ndegree.txt          (write the data to NDegree file)
        
        for ii and iii similar to the above
        
        cat NDegree.txt NMinutes.txt NSeconds.txt >NorthCoordinates.txt  (To create a file from combination of other three files)
        cp NorthCoordinates.txt /home/Desktop/Coordinate-Locations        (To copy the txt to a directory)
        cd..                                    (To come back)
        mv NorthCoordinate.txt North.txt         (Rename NorthCoordinate.txt to North.txt)
        rm NorthCoordinate.txt                    (To remove a file)
        
Similarly follow the above for step 4
 
Step 5:

         cat North.txt East.txt > Location-Coordinates.txt              (To create a file from combination of other two files)
